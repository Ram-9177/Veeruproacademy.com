# Docs
This folder contains the canonical documentation for the Django monolith baseline.

## Contents

- `migration/` — notes for migrating legacy data/features into Django.
- `deploy-live.md` — production deployment checklist and environment variables.
- `_legacy/` — preserved, read-only reference material extracted from the previous Next.js/Prisma implementation.

## Rule

If something is not documented here, treat it as non-canonical.
